**VK** offers flexible commentting tools that can be easily built into your website. This enables VK users to comment on your materials without having to register on your site.

Each comment may be broadcast on the commenter's **VK** page along with a link to the original article, if he so desires. The **commenter's friends** will see the post in their Newsfeeds and may join in the conversation.

Second level comments are synchronized between the user's page and your site. This ensures that the discussion continues on two platforms, drawing new participants from both.
