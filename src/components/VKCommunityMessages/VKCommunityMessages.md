# Community Messages Widget

With the help of "Community Messages" widget you can create a fast tool for communication with VK users and add it to your website. This lets you answer the user even if they are offline â€“ all your messages will be sent on behalf of the Community. 

The widget is located at the right-bottom corner and opens right after loading or by clicking. Please make sure that the Messages option has been enabled in the Community settings before embedding the widget. 

Important note: You can list allowed domains, enter a message for offline status and specify other parameters in the settings of a community you are embedding this widget on. 

If an administrator hasn't replied for a long time, as at nighttime, users will see a notice that the reply may take a while.
