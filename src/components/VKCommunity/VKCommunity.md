# Community Widget

A Community widget links your site with your **VK** community. Your users will be able to subscribe to your **VK** feed without leaving the page.

This widget can display photos of a user's **friends**, who follow the community, or random user pictures, in case there are none. You can also see member demographic stats by clicking on the followers count.

Alternatively the widget can display your **Community news** instead of pictures. In this case a small module above the feed features a photo of the user's closest friend among community followers and a counter, showing other friends in the community.

Older posts are **loaded automatically**, if you scroll the module down.
