# Like Widget

With **Like widget** your visitors can express their attitude towards an article with one click or immediately share the link to it with their friends.

You can always view the **full list** of users who liked the article and shared the link to it with their friends. Besides, using Browse Comments link you can view all **comments** left in VK for the posted links.

Values are different for each unique URL on your site. If an article on your site can have different URLs (e.g. depending on navigation source, language and other parameters), then the last parameter passed in **VK.Widgets.Like** shall be your internal ID of the page â€” **page_id**. See code example with **page_id** in widget [complete documentation](https://vk.com/dev/widget_like).

To receive the list of users who marked the page via Like widget you can use API [likes.getList](https://vk.com/dev/likes.getList) method.
