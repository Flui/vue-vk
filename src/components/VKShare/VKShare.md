# Share Button

If you embed **Post in VK** button under your articles or blog you will allow **100 million** VK users to share links to your materials with their friends.

Every time when a **VK** user clicks this button on your site, a note with the link to your site is automatically created on their **VK** page. After this, user's friends will be able to learn about the article immediately from My News page and from the personal page of the user who posted it.

Link to your site will always be available for all visitors of the page of the user who posted it. Thus, your site will be able to attract attention of additional visitors not only in the short period after this news appeared there. Thanks to this feature, **VK** posting stands out from other posting methods in the Internet.
